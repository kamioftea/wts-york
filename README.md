WTS Game Admin
==============

Small PlayFramework project to display a status page during the York SF&F Watch
the Skies Game.

Configuration
-------------

You will need to copy `config/application.local.config.dist` to `config/application.local.config`
and provide the configuration specified.

Node/Bower/Gulp
---------------

Currently the path of least resistance for building scss, js, etc.
for the project is using gulp/bower on top of node js. See the 
[Node README](node) for more details.
